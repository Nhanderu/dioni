A CLI that shuffle plays your saved tracks on Spotify.

## Why

I may be too paranoid, but I always felt like Spotify's shuffle play is fake. It
seems to play the same bands, or at least have some kind of intelligence behind
it.

So this project was born with the intention of having a **true random** queue
with your saved tracks.

But, again, I may be just too paranoid.
